# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matt Peachey!  I am a PhD student (Computer Science) at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience.html) in [Halifax, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax,_Nova_Scotia) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of **Human Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Machine Learning**, and **Digital Musical Instruments** but I am always interested in learning about and contributing to different projects. 


## Research

A list of some of the **research projects** I have contributed to:

* [Latent Representations of Synthesizer Patches](https://github.com/peacheym/LatentRepresentations) - Using generative ML models for synthesizer patch creation.
* [Maplet](https://github.com/peacheym/maplet) - A Eurorack Module that brings the libmapper eco-system to modular synthesis.
* [MoveBox: Democratizing MoCap for the Microsoft Rocketbox Avatar Library](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/movebox-democratizing-mocap-for-the-microsoft-rocketbox-avatar-library/) - A research project that included the development of the **MoveBox** toolkit.
* [StoryCreatAR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/story-creatar-a-toolkit-for-spatially-adaptive-augmented-reality-storytelling/) - a Toolkit for Spatially-Adaptive Augmented Reality Storytelling.
  
## Open Source
